# OctoAcme Project Management Docs

Welcome to the central index for OctoAcme project management processes and documentation.

## What is OctoAcme Project Management?

OctoAcme project management is built on principles of iterative delivery, customer value, clear ownership, and transparent communication. Our approach defines clear project phases (initiation, planning, execution, release, retrospective), roles, and best-practice workflows. Each process document details specific activities, responsibilities, and templates to make our work consistent and efficient.

### Core Principles

Our project management approach is guided by five fundamental principles:

- **Customer-first**: We prioritize customer value and usability in every decision. Understanding and solving customer problems drives our roadmap and delivery priorities.
- **Iterative delivery**: We deliver small, testable increments rather than big-bang releases. This allows us to gather feedback early, reduce risk, and adapt quickly to changing needs.
- **Clear ownership**: Each project has a named Project Manager (PM) and Product Lead. Clear accountability ensures decisions are made efficiently and stakeholders know who to contact.
- **Data-informed decisions**: We measure impact and iterate based on evidence. Metrics, user feedback, and retrospective insights guide our continuous improvement.
- **Psychological safety**: We encourage feedback, learning, and experimentation. Teams should feel safe raising concerns, proposing ideas, and learning from mistakes.

### Core Roles & Responsibilities

OctoAcme projects involve cross-functional collaboration across these key roles:

- **Project Manager (PM)**: Coordinates delivery activities, manages schedules, tracks risks and dependencies, facilitates key meetings, and ensures consistent project documentation and status reporting. The PM keeps the team aligned and unblocked.
- **Product Manager (PdM)**: Defines what should be built to deliver customer and business value. Owns the product vision, prioritizes the backlog, collaborates on trade-offs, and measures success through metrics and user research.
- **Developers**: Design, build, test, and deliver software components. They implement features that meet acceptance criteria, write tests and documentation, participate in design reviews, and help identify technical risks.
- **QA/Testing**: Validate quality and acceptance criteria. They ensure features meet requirements, perform functional and regression testing, and help define testing strategies.
- **Stakeholders**: Provide inputs, context, and approvals. They represent business needs, give feedback on direction, and help prioritize work based on organizational goals.

### Project Lifecycle

Projects follow a structured lifecycle to ensure consistency and quality:

1. **Initiation**: Define the problem statement, identify stakeholders, establish success criteria, and create a high-level timeline. Output: Project Charter or One-pager.
2. **Planning**: Scope the work, identify resources and dependencies, break down tasks, define milestones, and assess risks. Output: Detailed project plan, roadmap, and risk register.
3. **Execution**: Build features, test functionality, conduct reviews, and iterate based on feedback. Teams work in sprints or iterations with regular check-ins.
4. **Release**: Deploy to production, verify functionality, communicate changes to users, and monitor for issues. Ensure smooth rollout with rollback plans if needed.
5. **Close & Retrospective**: Capture learnings, celebrate wins, document what went well and what could improve, and identify action items for future projects.

### Communication Cadence

Regular, predictable communication keeps teams aligned:

- **Weekly PM + PdM sync**: Align on priorities, risks, and timeline adjustments
- **Twice-weekly standups**: Quick team check-ins on progress, blockers, and upcoming work (frequency can be adjusted based on team needs)
- **Monthly stakeholder updates**: Share progress, milestones achieved, upcoming work, and any major risks or changes
- **Ad-hoc escalations**: Address urgent issues, critical decisions, or blockers as they arise

### Key Artifacts

Teams use these artifacts to maintain clarity and alignment:

- **Project Charter / One-pager**: Concise overview of the project's purpose, goals, stakeholders, and success criteria
- **Roadmap and Release Plan**: Timeline showing planned features, milestones, and dependencies
- **Sprint/Iteration Backlog**: Prioritized list of work items for the current sprint or iteration
- **Acceptance Criteria & Definition of Done**: Clear standards that define when work is complete and ready to ship
- **Risk Register**: Living document tracking identified risks, their impact, likelihood, and mitigation plans
- **Retrospective notes and action items**: Learnings and improvements captured at the end of each project or sprint
